* Game where you need to delay cars from getting to their destination by imposing roadblocks and manipulating traffic.
* Card game where your cards have durability. Card game where if your creature cards die you don't get them back. You progress through a series of discrete matches, with time to change your deck in between. But over time your deck becomes more and more tattered and eventually you will be alone and die.
* Card game where you battle an immovable force. All you can do is weather the attacks and defend yourself.
  * The opponent goes first in every match. Most creatures have summoning sickness so you on your first turn just mount the defense.
  * Two parts of the game: 1. Exploration and deck building, 2. Matches
